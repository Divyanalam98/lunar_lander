In this project, we leverage the power of Reinforcement Learning algorithms to teach the lunar lander to navigate the complexities of landing safely on the moon's surface. 
The AI agent interacts with the lunar environment and learns from its actions, iteratively improving its landing strategies through rewards and penalties.
